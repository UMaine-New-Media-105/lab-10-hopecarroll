The task of the lab was to create a frogger game with cars moving bouncing of the walls, the frog moving with keyPressed and bringing the forg back to the start when it collides with a car. The cars bounce back and forth using a class called Car which creates a square and bounces off the wall by settting an equality that forces the car to not go past the width of the canvas. More cars were creatd with random colors in random lanes using an array that defined the colors and lanes and a loop which allows the cars to move over and over. The frog is defined as a seperate function which moves back and forth by clicking the up, down, right and left keys which was created using the keyPressed function. The collision between the cars and frog is created by using the "dist" function and a sepereate collison function that work to detect the collision between the frog and car and when they collide, bring the frog back to the start.
